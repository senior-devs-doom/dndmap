My notes about to app for myself. I was to lazy to delete ti.


RESTRUCTURE WHOLE THING WITH CHARACTER AS ACTUAL OBJECT(okay but why doe? so far the only downside has be no assigned functions which is like, meh.)


add custom size

moving characters in initiative tracker can bug the fuck out

loading presetcharacters has some lazyness scuff(tm)

UI for changing monstervault

maybe make it work as actual online app?

COMMENT AND CLEAN THIS BITCH UP
